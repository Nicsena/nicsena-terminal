# nicsena-terminal

An Node.js Express with EJS powered terminal made by Nicsena. This might or will be one of my open-source projects. I am thinking that Iâ€™m making a terminal with live output in express program controller, or not.

# Demo

### You can still access the old version of Nicsena Terminal at [https://nicsena-terminal-old.glitch.me/](https://nicsena-terminal-old.glitch.me/)
#### - The demo website doesn't have live output, and there's may or will be support for live output when the terminal gets released, and the terminal is in BETA.
#### - The demo website terminal haves a limited amount of commands to be ran. Due to the limited amount of commands, the code is currently very messy or messy, and I may try to clean up the code when the terminal gets released.
#### - Note: Entering a command will send a request to the website because it haves the some of the code in Express Program Controller but different.
