### Link: [https://nicsena-terminal.glitch.me/](https://nicsena-terminal.glitch.me/)
#### The demo won't let you to execute commands for several reasons. This is to prevent abuse and prevent the destroying of the project itself by someone else running a command that deletes all the files. The server will send back the command you typed in instead of executing it.
