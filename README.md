# nicsena-terminal
An Node.js Express with EJS powered terminal made by Nicsena.

# Demo Website:

### Link: [https://nicsena-terminal.glitch.me/](https://nicsena-terminal.glitch.me/ "https://nicsena-terminal.glitch.me/")
#### - The demo website doesn't have live output, and there's may or will be support for live output when the terminal gets released, and the terminal is in BETA.
#### - The demo website terminal haves a limited amount of commands to be ran. Due to the limited amount of commands, the code is currently very messy or messy, and I may try to clean up the code when the terminal gets released.
#### - Note: Entering a command will send a request to the website because it haves the some of the code in Express Program Controller but different.
